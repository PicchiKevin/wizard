title: Malicious Websites
---

One of the biggest dangers of the Web are intentionally malicious web sites. These are a smaller risk than they used to be since these days as they often get omitted from search results. But still sometimes they will come up organically.

Be careful when you follow a link from an advert or from a dodgy site such as a piracy or pornography site. Sites with little legitimate means of generating income will sometimes make money by linking through to dodgy scam sites. You may encounter posts which link to content like this on social media too. So be careful.

Sites like this are usually going for something quite malicious such as wanting to install some software on your device so that it can be used in a bot net. Or used to steal your identity. Don't run or install any computer programs where the download link doesn't begin with 'https://' or where you do not trust the website or software author.

The final type of risky site you will encounter are spoof websites. If you receive a text saying it's from your bank, phone company, Samsung or Microsoft or your government with a URL there is a good chance it is fake.

### Solution

Most importantly, Never install any ".APK" files you download through the browser!

Samsung will try to keep you safe whilst browsing using Google's safe browsing service. This securely checks whether the website you are on is dangerous and will alert you if it is.

This feature is turned on by default so you don't need to do anything.

It's regularly updated with lists of new dangerous Web Sites, but dangerous parties are always trying to make new dangerous Web Sites so you should still remain vigilant.

If you ever see this message then the site you have just tried to go to has been identified as dangerous and you should probably go back.
