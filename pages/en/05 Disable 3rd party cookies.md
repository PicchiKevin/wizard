title: Disable 3rd party cookies

This is a more extreme way of preventing cookie based tracking it prevents any cookies that do not belong to the Website you are on. For example if you are browsing "https://newspaper.com" and there are adverts provided by "https://goggle.com" then these adverts cannot access any identifying information they may have set as a cookie on another site.

This prevents the majority of ways tracking networks follow you around the Web. You turn them off using the  settings page at: 

Settings ➔ Sites and downloads ➔ Site permissions ➔ Cookies ➔ Block third-party cookies

This setting may break websites in rare cases, which is why it is not turned on by default, but will greatly enhance your privacy.
